# Timeout and Network Connection Error Fixes

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "Network connection error. Please check your internet connection and try again." that appeared after step 7 of the Claude Code generation process.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **timeout mismatch**:
- Step 7 (Claude Code generation) had a 10-minute timeout
- Client had a 15-minute timeout
- When Step 7 timed out, it was incorrectly categorized as a "network connection error"

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Core Timeout Fix ✅
**File:** `lovable-ui/scripts/generate-in-daytona.ts`
- **Increased Step 7 timeout** from 10 minutes to 20 minutes
- **Added progressive retry logic** with exponential backoff (20min → 25min → 30min)
- **Added timeout warnings** at 80% of timeout period
- **Maximum 3 retry attempts** with 10-second delays between retries

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
**File:** `lovable-ui/app/api/generate-daytona/route.ts`
- **Better error categorization** - distinguishes timeout vs network vs auth errors
- **Real-time timeout warnings** streamed to client via Server-Sent Events
- **Enhanced progress monitoring** for timeout-related messages
- **Specific error types**: `timeout_warning`, `timeout_info`, `error`

### 3. Client-Side Improvements ✅
**File:** `lovable-ui/app/generate/page.tsx`
- **Extended client timeout** from 15 minutes to 30 minutes
- **Better error differentiation** - timeout errors no longer appear as "network connection" errors
- **Enhanced UI feedback** - timeout warnings highlighted in yellow with warning styling
- **Specific error messages** with actionable guidance for users

### 4. User Experience Enhancements ✅
- **Real-time timeout warnings** - "⏱️ Generation is taking longer than expected"
- **Progressive retry feedback** - "🔄 Retry attempt 1/2" with extended timeouts
- **Clear error categorization**:
  - 🌐 Network errors (actual connectivity issues)
  - ⏱️ Timeout errors (generation taking too long)
  - 🚀 Daytona service errors (sandbox unavailable)
  - 🔑 Authentication errors (invalid API keys)

## New Timeout Configuration

| Component | Old Timeout | New Timeout | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Step 7 Generation | 10 minutes | 20 minutes | Base timeout |
| Step 7 Retry 1 | N/A | 25 minutes | +5min progressive |
| Step 7 Retry 2 | N/A | 30 minutes | +10min progressive |
| Client Timeout | 15 minutes | 30 minutes | Accommodates retries |

## Error Message Improvements

### Before:
- "Network connection error. Please check your internet connection and try again."

### After:
- **Timeout**: "⏱️ Generation Timeout: Claude Code generation consistently timed out after 3 attempts. Try breaking your prompt into smaller, more specific requests, or use the regular Claude Code generation instead."
- **Network**: "🌐 Network connection error. Please check your internet connection and try again."
- **Daytona**: "🚀 Daytona sandbox service is currently unavailable. This is usually temporary."

## User Benefits

1. **No more false "network connection" errors** - timeout issues are properly identified
2. **Automatic retry handling** - system attempts 3 times with increasing timeouts
3. **Real-time feedback** - users see timeout warnings and retry attempts
4. **Better guidance** - specific error messages with actionable solutions
5. **Fallback options** - clear path to switch to regular Claude Code generation

## Technical Benefits

1. **Proper error categorization** - different error types handled appropriately
2. **Resilient timeout handling** - progressive retry strategy
3. **Better observability** - enhanced logging and progress tracking
4. **Maintainable code** - clear separation of error types and handling

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible and enhance existing functionality.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with complex prompts that previously timed out
2. Verify timeout warnings appear at appropriate times
3. Confirm retry logic works with simulated timeouts
4. Test fallback to regular Claude Code generation
5. Verify actual network errors still show appropriate messages
