### **AI Integration**
- **Claude Code SDK** with subagents (10 parallel), session persistence
- **Real-time streaming** chat with WebSocket architecture
- **AI security** with prompt injection protection and model access controls

### **Security & Compliance**
- **SOC 2 & GDPR compliance** built-in from foundation
- **Zero-trust architecture** with adaptive authentication
- **Multi-tenant isolation** with physical/logical separation

### **Deployment & Migration**
- **Blue-green deployment** for zero-downtime releases
- **Feature flags** for progressive rollouts and canary releases
- **Automated rollback** with circuit breakers and emergency response
